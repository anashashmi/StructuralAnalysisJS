# StructuralAnalysisJS

This repository is established to develop a Structural Analysis Software in JavaScript.  This software will cover three facets of the software: Codifying the input of a structure, Calculation algorithms, and Visualization of the input and the results.

Progress will be made on all three facets as the progress of one facet demands needs of progress in the other facets.

Facet 1: A schema specification for input of a structure  
Facet 2: Algorithms to calculate results  
Facet 3: Visualization Engine using WebGL via ThreeJS.

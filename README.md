# StructuralAnalysisJS

This repository is established to develop a Structural Analysis Software in JavaScript.  This software will cover three facets of the software: Codifying the input of a structure, Calculation algorithms, and Visualization of the input and the results.

Progress will be made on all three facets as the progress of one facet demands needs of progress in the other facets.

Facet 1: A schema specification will be crafted to design how a structure will be inputted
Facet 2: Algorithms will be placed to calculate results
Facet 3: Visualization Engine will use WebGL via ThreeJS.
